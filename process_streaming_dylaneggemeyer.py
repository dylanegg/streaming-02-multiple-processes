Streaming Process - port 9999 

We'll use the MLB All Start Game data from 2021.

But we need to reverse the order of the rows 
so we can read oldest data first.

Important! We'll stream forever - or until we 
           read the end of the file. 
           Use use Ctrl-C to stop.
           (Hit Control key and c key at the same time.)
